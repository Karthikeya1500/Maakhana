# Maakhana Food — HomeCook Connect Platform

## Overview
**Maakhana Food** is a full-stack application that connects customers with home chefs state-wise across India. The platform enables customers to discover and order authentic, homemade food based on individual Indian states (e.g., Punjab, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Gujarat). Home chefs — verified local cooks who prepare traditional cuisines — can register on the platform, list their food items categorized by their native state, set pricing, and manage incoming orders.

The system provides two distinct dashboards:
1. **Customer Dashboard** — Browse food by state, manage cart, place orders, and rate chefs.
2. **HomeChef Dashboard** — Manage food listings, view and update orders, and track performance.

An **Admin** role oversees the platform — approving new chefs, managing users, and monitoring all orders.

## Problem Statement
1. **Lack of visibility for home chefs** — Talented home cooks across India have no centralized digital platform to showcase their authentic regional cuisines to a wider audience.
2. **Inaccessible regional food** — Customers craving authentic food from specific Indian states (e.g., Bengali sweets, Rajasthani dal baati, Kerala appams) struggle to find local home chefs who prepare these dishes.
3. **No trust or verification** — Without a verification and review system, customers cannot assess the quality or reliability of home chefs.
4. **Fragmented discovery** — Existing food delivery platforms focus on restaurants, not home-cooked food. Home chefs rely on word-of-mouth or social media, limiting their reach.
5. **No state-based filtering** — Customers wanting food from a specific state have no structured way to search and filter based on geographic cuisine categories.

## Proposed Solution
**Maakhana Food** solves these problems by creating a **state-centric food marketplace** that:
- Organizes all food by **individual Indian states** (e.g., Punjab, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Gujarat, Maharashtra).
- Allows **home chefs** to register, get verified by admins, and list their food items under their native state.
- Provides **customers** with powerful browsing and filtering tools to find authentic food from any Indian state.
- Implements a **review and rating system** so customers can rate chefs, building trust and accountability.
- Uses a **layered backend architecture** with OOP principles for clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
- Enforces **JWT-based authentication** and **role-based access control** (Customer, HomeChef, Admin) for security.

## Backend Architecture Approach
- **Clean Layered Architecture**: Controllers → Services → Repositories separation
- **OOP Principles**: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism throughout the domain model
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstracted behind repository interfaces
- **DTO Pattern**: Data Transfer Objects for clean data flow between layers
- **Middleware Pipeline**: Authentication middleware → Role authorization middleware → Controller
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with custom exception classes
- **SOLID Principles** adherence across all modules
